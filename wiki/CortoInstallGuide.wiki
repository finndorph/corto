#Corto install guide

= Introduction =

Corto is configured entirely by SAML2 metadata - no other configuration is needed.

Corto runs in demo mode right out of the box, using index.php as it's 'landing page' and the metadata file 'cortotest.meta.php as configuration. 

An optimized, internal representation of the metadata is automatically stored in /var/tmp/corto_optimized_metadata
 
===Configuration of Corto in a non-demo mode is done in two steps:===

We assume that we are installing in `/var/www/corto`and accessable at http://example.com/corto

  # Check out the Corto code from the repository
{{{
cd /var/www
svn checkout http://corto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ corto
}}}
  # Create a virtual host that maps `http://example.com/corto` to `/var/www/corto/public`
  # Test that the setup is working by going to `http://example.com/corto`
  # Creating the 'landing page' by coping that index.php to myproxy.php
{{{
cp /var/www/corto/public/index.php /var/www/corto/public/myproxy.php
}}}
  #
  # Configure a metadata import script
