#Corto install guide

= Introduction =

Corto is configured entirely by SAML2 metadata - no other configuration is needed.

Corto runs in demo mode right out of the box, using index.php as it's 'landing page' and the metadata file 'cortotest.meta.php as configuration. 

An optimized, internal representation of the metadata is automatically stored in /var/tmp/corto_optimized_metadata
